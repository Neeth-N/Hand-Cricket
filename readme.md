Handyx
Objective
The objective of the Handyx project is to create an interactive web application where users can engage in a simple game to accumulate scores by making choices. This game aims to provide an entertaining and engaging experience for users.

Background/Introduction
Handyx is a web-based game that involves a player choosing numbers from a set of options. The choices are visually represented by buttons with images. The game tracks the user's score and compares the user's choice with a randomly generated opponent's choice. If the choices match, the user loses the game, and the score resets.
